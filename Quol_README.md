Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

a) Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    ###software engineering is the systematic process of the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software 
     that can solve real-world problems.
                      ###importance 
     Supports Innovation and Digital Transformation.
     contributes significantly to the global economy by generating jobs. 
     

b) Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

c) List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
     --Initiation- define project goals and objectives and  conduct a feasibility study,
     --planning-define the project scope, schedule, and budget
     --Execution -assign tasks to team members and execute project plans
     --Monitoring and controlling-track project progress and performing quality control
     --Closure -Obtain formal acceptance of deliverables and finalize project activities.

d) Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    Waterfall--clear and sequential approach
    Agile--iterative and incremental approach to project and software management
                                 Advantages 
        Quick response to changes                                      clear structure and documentation
        regular customer feedback                                      is easy to manage due to its rigidity
                                 Disadvantages 
        less predictability                                             Difficult to accom changes
        customer involvement                                             testing occurs late in the process

e) Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

f) Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

g) What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

h) Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

a) Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

b) Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
